# Tests for scripts/lib.sh — the safety layer.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Every helper in lib.sh was written in response to a real incident, and
# then two of them shipped BROKEN and stayed broken because nothing ever exercised them:
#
#   - `safe_retag` died on every call with "unbound variable" (bash 3.2 + `set -u` + an empty
#     array), silently skipping the retag it exists to perform and leaving masters mistagged.
#   - `verify_bt709` could never pass on ANY file, because ffprobe prints these files' video
#     stream twice and it compared that against a single expected line.
#
# Neither is caught by shellcheck — verified: it reports nothing on the empty-array pattern while
# bash 3.2 fails on it immediately. Only running the code finds them.
#
# So the bar for every test here: delete the guard it covers and the test must go red. A test that
# cannot fail is worse than no test, because it reads as coverage.

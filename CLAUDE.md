# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code working in this repo. `README.md` is the human orientation; this file
carries what an agent needs on top of it — the traps, and where the source of truth lives.

Read `docs/PIPELINE.md` before changing the render chain, and `CONTEXT.md` before writing anything
down. Several words here mean one specific thing: *look* is not *tone* is not *grade*, a *spec* is
what you measure against and depart from deliberately, and a *baseline* is not a *master*.

## Run this before trusting any change

```sh
./scripts/check.sh        # shellcheck, curve parity, the bats suite
```

A **missing tool now fails the run** rather than skipping quietly. This command used to exit 0
having run only bats, so "green" could mean "linted nothing and never compared the curves". Use
`--allow-skips` to accept a partial run on purpose. Don't write the test count down anywhere: it is
printed, and a number in prose goes stale by construction — the README said 20 while the suite said
42.

**shellcheck and bats are not substitutes for each other.** shellcheck reported ZERO issues in
scripts that contained two shipped, load-bearing bugs. bats found both, because it runs the code on
the real interpreter — macOS ships **bash 3.2**, whose handling of empty arrays under `set -u`
differs from every modern bash. Run both.

## Filter rules, and where the reason lives

Each was a silent failure — no error, just wrong output — and each is measured. The rule is here so
you don't trip it; the measurement is in `docs/PIPELINE.md`, which is the only place it belongs.

- **`eq` is banned.** It silently negotiates an 8-bit format, so the chain quietly stops being
  10-bit. Check any new filter with `-v debug | grep "picking yuv"`.
- **`colorlevels` produces a flat frame** on this input. Use `curves`.
- **Only `zscale` dithers** the 10→8 bit reduction. `format=yuv420p` and `-sws_dither ed` are
  byte-identical, i.e. neither does anything.
- **`curves` interpolates with a cubic spline.** Past ~3 uneven control points it overshoots
  somewhere you didn't intend. Measure the result, don't trust the control points.
- **Tag every synthesised branch with `setparams`.** An untagged `lavfi` source propagates
  "unknown" backwards and fails a `zscale` several filters upstream. `mergeplanes` output is
  untagged the same way.
- **Grain goes after the sharpener, at half resolution.** Before it, the sharpener rings it.
- **`blend` needs `shortest=1`;** `-shortest` is not a substitute under `filter_complex`. The
  reasoning is in `lib.sh`, above `DELIVERY_BLEND`.
- **Verify colour tags after every encode.** `prores_ks` and `libx264` both ignored the flags here,
  and a wrongly tagged file is double-transformed by any player that trusts it. `safe_retag`.

## ffprobe misreports this camera's files in three ways

All silent, all cost real time, all caused by a `[STREAM_GROUP]` structure ordinary idioms don't
expect. The measurements and the shipped bugs each one caused are in `docs/PIPELINE.md`.

1. **The video stream prints twice**, plus a blank line.
2. **`-select_streams a:0` returns nothing** despite audio being present. `-map 0:a:0?` for ffmpeg
   is a different code path and is unaffected.
3. **csv output carries a trailing comma** (`3840,2160,`), so a field split fails open. It appears
   on camera originals and `-c copy` excerpts of them, never on the pipeline's own re-encodes, so
   it hides until real footage reaches it.

Query one field at a time with `-of default=nw=1:nk=1` and validate with a regex. Never trust a
single-line ffprobe answer without checking what it actually printed.

## Testing rules

- **Never write a bare `[[ ... ]]` assertion.** In bats 1.14 a `[[ ]]` that returns false in the
  *middle* of a test body does not fail the test: `[[` is a shell keyword and the mechanism bats
  uses to spot a failure only tracks simple commands, so the verdict comes from the body's LAST
  command. `[` is a builtin and behaves as expected. Every `[[ ]]` in `tests/lib.bats` therefore
  ends in `|| fail "..."`, which is a function call and so is seen. This had already hidden a real
  defect: a test stayed green while the message it asserts on was renamed. Do not tidy the guard
  away.
- **Mutation-test anything you add.** Break the guard, confirm the test goes red. Two tests here
  passed against a *removed* guard before this was done, and two more passed against a removed
  guard again afterwards for the `[[ ]]` reason above. Apply the mutation and *verify it applied* —
  a `perl -0pi -e` whose pattern silently fails to match proves nothing, and looked like a pass.
- **The production filter graph needs a real render.** shellcheck cannot see inside a filter
  string, the parity check touches only the tone curve, and a `DRY=1` run never builds the graph.
  `PROOF=<seconds>` renders through the identical chain, which is what the suite uses.
- **Synthetic fixtures cannot reproduce this camera's quirks.** A generated ProRes file prints one
  clean ffprobe line; a real clip prints three with a trailing comma. Tests covering those
  behaviours must use real footage from `src/` and skip when it is absent.
- A test that cannot fail is worse than no test — it reads as coverage.

## Things that are settled, don't re-litigate

- **Tone, not colour.** Apple's CST is already colorimetrically accurate (traffic blue at B/G 1.99
  against a 1.98 spec, nothing applied). Hours went into "fixing" colour that was correct. The
  flatness was tone: ~25% too bright with nothing reaching black.
- **The shipped look is deliberately off-spec** (saturation 1.27 puts that blue at 2.39). That is
  the grade, not an error. Do not "correct" it toward the reference.
- **Rotation is an ingest concern.** No rotation logic in the pipeline; the source is trusted. The
  one guard decodes a frame and measures it, refusing non-portrait rather than squashing it.
- **The scene-linear filmic route was tried and lost on colour.** Its measurements are in
  `docs/adr/0002_KEEP_APPLES_CST.md`; the cubes themselves are gitignored, so `luts/filmic/` holds
  only `SOURCE.txt` on a fresh clone and is regenerated from `scripts/make-filmic-lut.py`.
- **Look values live in `look.json`,** never hardcoded in a script. `grade.sh` broke this with its
  own copy of the tone block, so a grade from the Bench changed `shipped.cube` and the staged path
  while production kept rendering the old tone. `look()` has **no fallbacks** on purpose: a missing
  key must stop the run, not substitute a different look. That makes the key set a contract, and a
  test checks the scripts and `look.json` against each other.
- **`shipped.cube` freshness is by CONTENT, not mtime.** Each generated cube stamps its parameters
  into its `TITLE` and `make-tone-lut.py` skips the write when they already match. mtime cannot
  work: git does not preserve it, so on a fresh clone the committed cube always lands newer than
  `look.json` and would be trusted forever.
- **The grade chain and the delivery chain live once each, in `lib.sh`.** Both were copies that
  drifted: the delivery filters were three (two stage-3 scripts, now one `03-final.sh`
  parameterised by target, plus `grade.sh`), and the grade head was two, with nothing in the suite
  rendering the staged one. A test now fails if a stage script starts building either again. The
  measurements that justify each filter live next to its builder.
- **Never point `ffmpeg -y` at a delivery path.** It truncates the existing file before it knows
  whether the graph initialises, so a failed re-render destroys the approved deliverable — measured
  at 0 bytes with ffmpeg exiting 234. Use `render_delivery`, which stages, checks and tags before
  installing. A test pins this, because it was reintroduced once while rewriting stage 3.
- **Orientation is settled in ADR 0005, the media layout in ADR 0006.** Removing rotation in pieces
  left a runbook step telling you to pass an argument that was silently ignored; when a concept is
  deleted, grep for its name in prose too.

## Style

Tabs in shell scripts. Comments explain *why* — a rejected alternative, a measurement, a trap —
never *what*. Most of the comments in `scripts/` exist to stop a future reader "simplifying" away
something that was expensive to learn.

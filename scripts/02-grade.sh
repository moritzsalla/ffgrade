# Stage 2: baseline -> graded master (look LUT + tone curve + colour, i.e. the whole grade).
# Usage: ./02-grade.sh IMG_XXXX
# Reads dist/01-baseline/<clip>_baseline.mov, writes dist/02-graded/<clip>_graded.mov.
#
# THE TONE LUT IS THE POINT. The Portra LUT alone leaves the image far too bright and flat
# ("milky"): nothing reaches black and the whole frame sits ~25% too high. shipped.cube fixes that.
# Don't drop it thinking it's redundant — see docs/PIPELINE.md, "Tone shaping".
#
# The graph itself is grade_chain in lib.sh, shared with grade.sh so a look cannot move on one
# path and not the other. Its header carries the reasoning — luma-only tone, and why both branches
# must be yuv444p10le. This stage adds only the ProRes encode: no CST (stage 01 did it) and no
# setparams (nothing downstream here negotiates a colourspace).
#
# The saturation and warmth below are a CREATIVE choice made by eye in the Grade Bench, not a
# correction. Measured against the standardised colours in frame, the Apple CST's own colour is
# already accurate (traffic blue lands at B/G 1.99 against a 1.98 spec with nothing applied). The
# values here deliberately depart from that. Change them because the look should change, never
# because a reading looks "wrong" — being off-spec here is the intent.

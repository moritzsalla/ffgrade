# Stage 3: graded master -> delivery.
# Usage: ./03-final.sh IMG_XXXX [reels|feed] [CROP_Y]
#
#   reels  9:16, 1080x1920 — Reels and Stories. The default.
#   feed   4:5, 1080x1350 — a Feed post, cropped from the portrait master.
#
#   CROP_Y applies to `feed` only: the vertical offset (in pixels on the 2160x3840 master) where
#          the 2160x2700 crop window starts. Default 750 is IMG_0609's biased-up crop, which
#          removes the parking-ceiling strip at the top and keeps the ivy plus a little more road
#          at the bottom. It is NOT assumed correct for every clip's composition — eyeball a crop
#          preview per clip and pass the right offset.
#
# WHY ONE SCRIPT. This was two, 86% identical line for line, and they had already drifted: the
# grain rationale existed in the reels copy only. The two deliverables differ in four values —
# output size, grain plate size, whether a crop precedes the downscale, and the output name — so
# they are arguments, not files. The chain itself now lives once in lib.sh, next to the
# measurements that justify each part of it.

# If a transform exists (from 00-stabilise-detect.sh), the sway is smoothed out before the
# downscale, so the warp resamples at full resolution rather than at delivery size. It also fixes
# a colour artefact: handheld sway slides high-contrast edges across the chroma sampling grid, so
# chroma fringing PHASE-SHIFTS frame to frame and reads as a shimmer along the street-sign
# lettering. Holding the frame still stops the shimmer moving; the chroma denoise in the chain
# removes what remains. Neither alone gets it.
#
# Freshness is judged against the SOURCE clip, not this stage's input: transforms are motion-only
# and survive a re-grade, so a re-rendered master must not invalidate one. See transform_is_fresh.

# Usage: ./01-baseline.sh IMG_XXXX
#
# Rotation is NOT handled anywhere in this pipeline. Orientation is an ingest concern and the
# source is trusted — see docs/adr/0005 and CLAUDE.md. This stage does not check it either: a
# baseline is not a deliverable, so a sideways clip here is merely sideways. The refusal lives in
# the two final stages, where a landscape frame would be silently squashed into a vertical
# delivery. That is the failure worth catching, and catching it costs a decode, so it is paid once
# at the point where it matters.

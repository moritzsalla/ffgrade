# Stage 0 (optional): analyse camera motion, producing transforms the final stages apply.
# Usage: ./00-stabilise-detect.sh IMG_XXXX
# Reads dist/02-graded/<clip>_graded.mov, writes dist/stab/<clip>.trf
#
# Numbered 00 but run LAST in practice — it needs the master, and it is only worth running on a
# clip that was shot handheld. A clip on a tripod needs nothing. The finals skip stabilisation
# silently when no .trf exists for the clip, so this is opt-in per clip.
#
# WHY IT ALSO FIXES A COLOUR ARTEFACT: handheld sway slides high-contrast edges across the chroma
# sampling grid frame by frame, so chroma fringing does not sit still — it phase-shifts, and reads
# as a shimmer crawling along fine lettering (spotted on the street sign, described as "moving like
# a sine wave"). Holding the frame still stops the shimmer moving; the finals' hqdn3d chroma pass
# removes what is left. Neither alone gets it.
#
# Cost: roughly 65s for a 26s 4K clip on this machine (measured 12.4s for a 5s segment). Analysis
# is decode-bound, so it is far cheaper than the encode that follows.
#
# Detection runs on the MASTER, at full 4K, so the transforms are in master pixel units and the
# finals can warp before downscaling — the warp then resamples at 4K instead of at delivery size.
# Transforms describe MOTION only, so they survive a re-grade: change the look or tone and the
# same .trf still applies. Only a change to rotation or framing invalidates it.

# Write to a temp file, install on success only. An interrupted detect (Ctrl-C, a killed background
# job) otherwise leaves a TRUNCATED .trf in place of a good one, and the failure surfaces much
# later and somewhere else: the finals die deep in the filter graph with "Cannot parse localmotion:
# unexpected end of file", which does not point back here at all. Learned by doing exactly that —
# a two-second smoke test destroyed a three-minute analysis.

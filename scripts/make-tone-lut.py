Generate a 1D .cube LUT: a filmic S-curve applied in DISPLAY space (Rec.709 in, Rec.709 out).

WHY THIS AND NOT THE OTHER ONE
------------------------------
make-filmic-lut.py replaces Apple's CST entirely, doing log -> linear -> tonemap -> Rec.709. That
is the textbook-correct architecture and it produces a better *tone* response, but it lost on
*colour*: a naive BT.2020->709 matrix plus a global saturation multiplier could not match Apple's
CST, which lands the standardised traffic-blue at B/G 1.97 against a 1.98 spec while keeping more
brick separation. Apple's gamut handling is better than anything hand-rolled here.

So: keep Apple's CST for colour, and do the tone shaping afterwards with this. Display-space
shaping cannot recover highlight detail the CST already compressed, but the CST does not clip
(measured YMAX 884/1023 on this footage), so there is room to work.

Why a generated 1D LUT rather than ffmpeg's `curves` filter: `curves` interpolates control points
with a cubic spline that overshoots past identity when the slope between segments is uneven —
this pipeline hit that twice, once producing an image *brighter* than the uncorrected version.
A 4096-entry 1D LUT is evaluated exactly, with no interpolation surprises.

Apply with ffmpeg's `lut1d` filter.

USAGE
    ./make-tone-lut.py OUT.cube [--pivot 0.42] [--contrast 1.25]
                                [--toe 0.30] [--shoulder 0.30] [--black 0.0]

    --gamma     midtone level, applied FIRST: v = x**gamma. >1 darkens. Needed because contrast
                pivoted about a point BELOW the image's own average brightens rather than
                shapes it — this footage averages 0.65, so a 0.42 pivot alone made it brighter.
                Set gamma so the average lands near the pivot, then let contrast do the shaping.
    --pivot     tonal level held (roughly) fixed while contrast pivots around it.
    --contrast  slope at the pivot. >1 increases contrast.
    --toe       how much the shadows roll off instead of clipping. Higher = softer, more film-like
                shadow; 0 = hard linear into black.
    --shoulder  same for highlights. This is what stops bright areas going to flat paper-white.
    --black     black point lift (>0) or crush (<0), applied last.

#!/bin/bash
# Lint + test the pipeline. Run before trusting any change to scripts/.
#
# Neither tool is a substitute for the other, and this pipeline has proof:
#   - shellcheck found ZERO issues in scripts that contained two shipped, load-bearing bugs.
#   - bats found both, because it runs the code on the actual interpreter (bash 3.2 on macOS,
#     whose empty-array handling under `set -u` differs from every modern bash).
# Run both.
#
# A MISSING TOOL IS A FAILURE, NOT A PASS. This is the command CLAUDE.md tells you to trust, and
# it used to exit 0 having skipped shellcheck and the curve parity check — so "green" could mean
# "ran the bats suite and nothing else". Each skip is now recorded and the run exits non-zero at
# the end, naming what did not run. Pass --allow-skips when you genuinely want a partial run, e.g.
# iterating on one bats test without node installed.

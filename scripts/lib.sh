# Shared safety helpers for every stage script. Source this, don't copy it —
# the retag/verify pattern exists because both mistakes below actually happened once:
#
#   1. prores_ks (and libx264) don't reliably stamp -color_primaries/-color_trc/-colorspace
#      mid-encode. A file can measure bt2020 tags after encode despite those flags being passed,
#      even though the pixels were already correctly transformed — any tag-trusting player then
#      double-transforms the image (this is the "bleached out" bug). Fix: always re-verify with
#      ffprobe after ANY encode step in this pipeline, and re-tag via a fast -c copy remux if wrong.
#   2. -map 0 copies every stream, including ones the target container can't hold (a ProRes .mov's
#      QuickTime timecode data track has no mp4 equivalent) — that remux fails, and if the
#      following `mv` isn't conditional on success, it moves the failed (0-byte) output over a
#      good file, destroying it. This happened for real and cost one full re-render.
#
# Every stage script below must: encode -> check output is non-empty -> verify/fix tags via
# explicit stream mapping -> mv only after confirming the retag succeeded.

#      plus a blank separator line. An early version compared the whole multi-line output against
#      one expected value and so false-failed on every correctly tagged file.
#   2. csv output carries a TRAILING COMMA on camera-structured files — "bt709,bt709,bt709," — so
#      taking the first non-empty csv line still could never equal "bt709,bt709,bt709". Measured

# THE GRADE ITSELF, as a spliceable filter chain: look LUT, tone curve, saturation, warmth. Both

# a grade sent from the Bench moved one path and not the other), and NOTHING in the suite renders
# the staged graph, so a second divergence would ship in silence. One builder, two callers, the
# same reasoning as the delivery chain below.
#
# TONE ON THE LUMA PLANE ONLY. A per-channel contrast curve crushes a saturated colour's two low
# channels harder than its high one, so saturated things get more saturated — the traffic signage
# went visibly neon long before it was measured. Curving luma and merging the ORIGINAL chroma back
# gives the same tone with colour untouched. `0x001112` = plane 0 from input 0 (the toned luma),
# planes 1 and 2 from input 1. Measurements in docs/PIPELINE.md, "The fix: apply the tone curve to

# won back with a uniform boost.

#      never there. Half-resolution grain keeps its own structure through the same re-encode
#      (0.75 -> 0.59).
#   2. Clustered is also CHEAPER: bitrate against no grain is 3.7x per-pixel, 2.9x clustered. More
#      filmic and ~22% cheaper to encode, which is not the usual trade. (`-tune grain` was tested
#      too: 4.3x bitrate for no structural gain. Skipped.)
#   3. It must come after the sharpener. Grain before `unsharp` gets RUNG by it — the isolated
#      residual shows a negative lag-1 (-0.09), the signature of an overshoot either side of every
#      spike, which reads as "crunchy digital" rather than film. It is also WEAKER than intended
#      (sd 2.65 vs 3.67 at the same c0s) because the sharpener averages it away.

# The plate is flat grey so its chroma stays neutral and `grainmerge` is a no-op on the chroma
# planes — measured U-plane residual sd 0.000, i.e. verifiably luma-only. That matters because the
# hqdn3d pass exists to clean chroma up, and grain must not put any back.
